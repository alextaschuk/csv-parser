# CSV Parser

- This is an auxiliary program to RateMyLecture that parses raw CSV data from [Donney F's UBC Pair Grade Data](https://github.com/DonneyF/ubc-pair-grade-data/tree/0e40aa0b80210d0a53e86e15bdc066995a176cab/tableau-dashboard-v2) for the 2021S-2023S sessions of UBC's Vancouver and Okanagan campuses. It extracts the relevant data, including year, session, subject, course, title, and prof, and converts it to JSON. The resulting JSON data is then written into two separate JSON files, each corresponding to the respective campus.
